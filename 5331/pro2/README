osproj2a:
the program uses a thread array to creat threads 
and pass in the number of threads to create via command line arguments.
-void *printMessage(void *ptr) is used to display thread number on screen 
and to excute Mutex.


osproj2b:
the program passes a number into thread1 and then thread1 return true or 
false.
The second one will take it and echo it and the number
-void isPrime(int) is used to judge if a input number is a prime.
-void* function1(void *ptr) is used to call isPrime function and excute 
Mutex.
-void* printMessage(void* ptr) is used to output the prompt and result.

osproj2c:
process0 sent message to process1.
process1 received message from process0, modify it and sent it to 
process2.
process2 received message from process1, modify it and sent it to 
process0.

The whole project has been tested.
It cost me 5 days.
ps:I forgot the due day is Friday. Actually I'v done on Thursday except my 
README note....
