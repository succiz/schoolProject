Classes defined: KonaneError, Konane, Player, SimplePlayer,
RandomPlayer, HumanPlayer

New feature: See the SimplePlayer class for an example of how to limit
the time that a method will run.  For the Konane tournament, your
minimax player's getMove method must run within 5 seconds.  Notice how
the getMove method is called within the playOneGame method.  If the
getMove method times out, then a random move is chosen instead.

Bug fix: When doing mulitple inheritance in the player classes,
must explicitly initialize the second base class.

    This class implements Konane, the Hawaiian version of checkers.
    The board is represented as a two-dimensional list.  Each 
    location on the board contains one of the following symbols:
       'B' for a black piece
       'W' for a white piece
       '.' for an empty location
    The black player always goes first.  The opening moves by both
    players are special cases and involve removing one piece from
    specific designated locations.  Subsequently, each move is a
    jump over one of the opponent's pieces into an empty location.
    The jump may continue in the same direction, if appropriate.
    The jumped pieces are removed, and then it is the opponent's
    turn.  Play continues until one player has no possible moves,
    making the other player the winner.
